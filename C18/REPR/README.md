# Test coverage

The initial test coverage report indicates 97.2% Line Coverage and 63.1% Branch coverage for the Web assembly.
Most of the not tested branches are related to the constructor injection guards that we have no unit tests for.

## How to collect code coverage

```bash
# 1. Generage the coverage.cobertura.xml file
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# 2. Generate the repport based on the previous file (change the GUID by the GUID generated by the collector)
reportgenerator -reports:"Web.Tests\TestResults\b74d6e70-a4f3-49ff-bf3c-00e4abba742c\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html
```

## Prerequisites

Run once to install the `reportgenerator` global tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```
